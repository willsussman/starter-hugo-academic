abstract = {Modern distributed applications run across numerous microservices and components deployed in cloud datacenters, using shared cloud services for computing and storage, edge services such as content distribution networks, network functions such as rate limiters and firewalls, security infrastructures, network routers, and physical links. When a user-visible fault occurs, the first step toward diagnosis is localization to determine where the fault has occurred. However, because application delivery spans different layers and different organizations, no entity has complete visibility or access to the information required to localize faults quickly. This paper proposes a cross-layer, cross-domain, and cross-application fault localization primitive with a simple and standardized information interface for the Internet.},
