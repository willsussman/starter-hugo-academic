abstract: A soil extractor is provided that allows a user to displace a drill
  bit along a drill pathway and collect a sample of soil at a desired depth
  without contaminating the sample with portions of the drill bit or any other
  portion of the soil extractor. Bushings protect the extractor itself, as well
  as the container/bucket from chipping or damage from the drill bit. This
  protection is what prevents contamination of the soil sample.
