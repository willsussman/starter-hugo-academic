I'm a PhD student in the Networks and Mobile Systems group at MIT CSAIL, advised by Hari Balakrishnan. I am supported by a Jacobs Presidential Fellowship.

Previously I was an undergraduate at Yale, where I worked on programmable radio environments with Wenjun Hu. I also started an IEEE Student Branch which was named best in the Northeast.
