Hello, world! I'm a PhD student and Jacobs Presidential Fellow in the Networks and Mobile Systems group at MIT CSAIL, advised by Hari Balakrishnan. I work part-time for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and plan to complete the MIT Graduate Certificate Program in Science, Technology and Policy.

Previously I was an undergraduate at Yale, where I worked on programmable radio environments with Wenjun Hu. I also started an IEEE Student Branch which was named best in the Northeast.

My one-page resume can be found {{< staticref "will-sussman-resume.pdf" "newtab" >}}here{{< /staticref >}}. Some highlights are below.
